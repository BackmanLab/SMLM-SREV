# Program: overlapfilter.in
# Author: Rivaan Kakkaramadam
# Description: The purpose of this simulation is to generate the number of SREV nucleosomes after LAMMPS' overlapping filter process. This is critical for
# calculating the input parameters needed to simulate the diffusion of the mobile objects at a consistent temperature.
